# Network-bandwidth-utilization
This project uses an LSTM model to predict network bandwidth (Mbps) based on historical data. It helps optimize network resources, plan for future capacity, and detect anomalies. Key features include data normalization, evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE), and visualizations of actual vs. predicted data.
